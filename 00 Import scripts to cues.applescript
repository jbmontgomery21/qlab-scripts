-- @description Import scripts to cues
-- @author Ben Smith
-- @link bensmithsound.uk
-- @version 1.2
-- @testedmacos 10.13.6
-- @testedqlab 4.6.10
-- @about Run this script in MacOS's "Script Editor" to quickly create script cues using the scripts in this repository. As of Qlab 4.6.9 you cannot set "run in separate process" through applescript. Input your default, and the script will alert you if you need to change it.
-- @separateprocess TRUE

-- @changelog
--   v1.2  + updated console logging to log all available information when not all metadata tags are provided
--         + non-tagged scripts now import into cues named without ".applescript" extension
--         + updated trimLine function formatting (replaced snake_case with camelCase)


-- USER DEFINED VARIABLES -----------------

set defaultSeparateProcess to "TRUE" -- your Qlab default for script cues as a string, either "TRUE" or "FALSE"

set versionWarnings to true -- set to false if you do not with to be notified about version differences between your system and the system the scripts have been tested on
